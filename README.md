# Project 6
Making a website that holds a portfolio of my the projects I have completed in FullStack JavaScript TechDegree from TreeHouse. 
I'll be using Static Node and Express Site to display images of all of my projects and dynamically and add a second route to each specific project when the project image is clicked.
